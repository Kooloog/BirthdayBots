# Birthday Bots

Here's the code I use to <b>run all of my birthday bots</b>: both the Animal Crossing (in its two languages) and the Fire Emblem ones.

Please note that the images that the bot posts are <b>done mostly manually</b>, by doing a simple GET request to obtain who celebrates their birthday on a certain day.

Also, this code uses API keys provided by the Twitter Developers Portal to work, which are <b>private</b> therefore I can't share them, so this code <b>won't work</b> if you try to run it yourself as it is right now.

Finally, the database folder contains all files that the main program reads. They're <b>incomplete (done intentionally, as an example)</b> and only have a few characters, but that's more than enough to understand the whole process, though I can still upload the full databases if you ask for them!

I uploaded this code to GitHub in case anyone's curious about how my bots work and, with just a bit of knowledge in programming, you'll see that it's actually <b>pretty easy and takes fewer lines of code</b> than you'd expect!

I've tried to leave enough comments so anyone can understand what the bot does and how it works. Still, feel free to ask me any questions!
